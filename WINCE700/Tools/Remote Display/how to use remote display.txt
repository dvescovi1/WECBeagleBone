
Device side remote display support is built into the image.
To start the clent side you can telnet into the device and enter:
cerdisp -c

Start the host side application on your PC (cehost_IP.exe) and enter File->Connect.
The device should pop into the "Active target devices", select and hit OK.
Remote display should be presented.

Automatically launching client side on power up can be acheived by placing a small
batch file in a "Startup" folder on the uSD card.

Create a "Startup" folder on the uSD card and place a small batch file with the following command:
START cerdisp -c


Good luck.
